abstract = {Respiratory variations in pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude (DeltaPOP) can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients but cannot be easily assessed at the bedside. Pleth variability index (PVI) is a new algorithm allowing for automated and continuous monitoring of DeltaPOP. We hypothesized that PVI can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients under general anaesthesia.},

abstract = {The primary objective of this study was to determine whether alterations in the pulse oximeter waveform characteristics would track progressive reductions in central blood volume. We also assessed whether changes in the pulse oximeter waveform provide an indication of blood loss in the hemorrhaging patient before changes in standard vital signs.},
